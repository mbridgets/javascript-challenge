UFO Level 1 - reads data from data.js onto our webpage via the HTML and app.js files.  The data is read onto the html using the .forEach functionon line seven.
Then the filter button is used to filter the data by date. This is done through the searchDate function which clears the table on the webpage via the HTML and re-fills the 
table based on the date entered in the search field.

UFO Level 2 - this app.js file does the same thing as the UFO Level 1 file plus allows the user to filter for additional criteria.
